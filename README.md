# Dynamics of double pendulum 

## Summary 

The arm and the golf club are modelled like a double pendulum. Assumed a horizontal compressed spring which gives the club required energy to hit the ball. The animation generated shows the impact of club and the ball initially and later the impacts of the ball with the wall (situated at -10m) and the grounda. Initial configuration of golf ball is -0.25 in X direction and 1.5 in Y direction and orientation of golf ball is 0 and initial configuration of arm is 90° and that of golf club is 0° and initially all the objects are at rest.
