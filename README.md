# Dynamics of double pendulum 

## Summary 

The arm and the golf club are modelled like a double pendulum. Assumed a horizontal compressed spring which gives the club required energy to hit the ball. The animation generated shows the impact of club and the ball initially and later the impacts of the ball with the wall and the ground.

** Before Impact of Golf club and Golf Ball:**

Lagrangian = (Linear Kinetic Energy of Arm + Rotational Kinetic Energy of Arm + Linear Kinetic Energy Golf Club + Rotational Kinetic Energy of Golf Club + Linear Kinetic Energy of Ball + Rotational Kinetic Energy of Ball - Potential Energy of Arm - Potential Energy of Golf Club - Potential Energy of Ball - Potential Energy of Spring)
